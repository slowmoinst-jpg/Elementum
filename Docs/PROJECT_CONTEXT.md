# Project Context

Updated: 2026-02-22
Context state: reset by user request.

## Confirmed Process
- Development restarts from a clean planning cycle.
- No runtime implementation before architecture and plan approval.
- Work is delivered in gated iterations with explicit status tracking.
- Commit is created only after explicit user confirmation.

## Current Technical State
- Runtime implementation context is intentionally cleared.
- Existing workspace changes are not treated as approved baseline yet.

## Next Action
- Produce Stage 0 planning package for user review and approval.
